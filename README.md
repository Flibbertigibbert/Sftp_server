# 🐳 Self-Hosted SFTP Server (Docker)

This project sets up a simple and secure SFTP server using Docker and the [atmoz/sftp](https://hub.docker.com/r/atmoz/sftp) image.  
It creates a user with upload access and can be deployed locally or to any cloud platform that supports Docker (like Fly.io, Railway, Render, etc.).
